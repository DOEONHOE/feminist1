  <h2> The Second Wave </h2>
  <p>Second-wave feminism is a period of feminist activity and thought that first began in the early 1960s in the United States. It quickly spread across the Western world with an aim to increase equality for women by gaining more than just voting rights. Issues addressed by the second-wave included rights regarding domestic issues (such as clothing) and in employment. In the '60s and much of the former and early 20th century in the Western and Eastern world, women did not tend to seek employment due to their engagement with domestic and household duties, which was seen as their primary duty but often left them isolated within the home and estranged from politics, economics, and law making.

Whereas first-wave feminism focused mainly on suffrage and overturning legal obstacles to gender equality (e.g., voting rights and property rights), second-wave feminism broadened the debate to include a wider range of issues: sexuality, family, the workplace, reproductive rights, de facto inequalities, and official legal inequalities.[1] Second-wave feminism also drew attention to domestic violence and marital rape issues, establishment of rape crisis and battered women's shelters, as well as changes in custody and divorce law. Feminist-owned business such as bookstores, credit unions, and restaurants were among the key meeting spaces and economic engines of the movement.[2]

Many historians view the second-wave feminist era in America as ending in the early 1980s with the intra-feminism disputes of the feminist sex wars over issues such as sexuality and pornography, which ushered in the era of third-wave feminism in the early 1990s.[3]</p>
