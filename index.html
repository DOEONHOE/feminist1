    target="_blank" title="feminism specification">Feminism</a> is a range of <strong>political movements, <u>ideologies</u>, and social movements</strong> that share a common goal: to define, establish, and achieve political, economic, personal, and social equality of sexes.
  This includes seeking to establish educational and professional opportunities for women that are equal to those for men.</p>

  <p style="margin-top:45px;">Feminist movements have campaigned and continue to campaign for women's rights, including the right to vote, to hold public office, to work, to earn fair wages or equal pay, to own property, to receive education, to enter contracts, to have equal rights within marriage, and to have maternity leave. Feminists have also worked to ensure access to legal abortions and social integration, and to protect women and girls from rape, sexual harassment, and domestic violence. Changes in dress and acceptable physical activity have often been part of feminist movements.</p>
